## Setup

**All config is defined in [site.config.ts](./site.config.ts).**

This project requires a recent version of Node.js (>= 14.17).

1. Fork / clone this repo
2. Change a few values in [site.config.ts](./site.config.ts)
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev` to test locally
5. `npm run deploy` to deploy to vercel 💪

I tried to make configuration as easy as possible — All you really need to do to get started is edit `rootNotionPageId`.

We recommend duplicating the [default page](https://notion.so/7875426197cf461698809def95960ebf) as a starting point, but you can use any public notion page you want.

Make sure your root Notion page is **public** and then copy the link to your clipboard. Extract the last part of the URL that looks like `7875426197cf461698809def95960ebf`, which is your page's Notion ID.

In order to find your Notion workspace ID (optional), just load any of your site's pages into your browser and open up the developer console. There will be a global variable that you can access called `block` which is the Notion data for the current page. If you enter `block.space_id`, it will print out your page's workspace ID.

I recommend setting up a collection on your home page that contains all of your articles / projects / content. There are no structural constraints on your Notion workspace, however, so feel free to add content as you normally would in Notion.
